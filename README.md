# Deep-Learning
Tsinghua University - Deep Learning (Winter 2020)

This course serves as an introduction to deep learning, and is considerably easier than the advanced machine learning course offered in the fall semester. Leaves me with more time to focus on research I guess...


Homework 1 -- Logistic Regression

Homework 2 -- MNIST Classification with MLP & Softmax

Homework 3 -- MNIST Classification with ConvNet

Homework 4 -- MNIST Classification on PyTorch

Homework 5 -- Sentence-level Sentiment Classification

Homework 6 -- EM Algorithm for Mixture of Gaussians. *(Although not required, I have implemented a fully vectorized EM with no loops)
